// Non-blocking, event-driven architecture:
// Node.js uses an asynchronous, event-driven model, allowing it to efficiently handle multiple concurrent connections without incurring performance issues. This makes it ideal for building scalable web applications.

// Single language for client and server:
// With JavaScript as the primary language, developers can build both front-end and back-end components using a single language, streamlining the development process.
